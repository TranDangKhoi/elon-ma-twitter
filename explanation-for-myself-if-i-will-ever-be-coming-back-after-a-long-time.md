I've also commented some stuff in the code itself (some are in Vietnamese, some are in English, i'm sorry), so in this markdown I'll just explain about some confusing stuffs for future Khoi ðŸ¤“ if he'll ever be coming back to update this project

### 1\. About this route/:tweet_id/children

Although you see that I'm naming the first segment /:tweet_id, but this api also return comments not only retweets and quote tweets. Because comments in this project are actually also counted as tweets

### 2\. Uhhh, the HLS Video feature is not even half done yet, if future Khoi has time, please update it, cuz present Khoi is too lazy

### 3\. If any accounts are banned, it will be determined by the UserVerifyStatus in enums. If verify status = 2, then that means the account is banned from the platform

### 4\. The route GET /tweets/:tweet_id is to check if that tweet is bookmarked by the current user or not.

### 5\. MongoDB's update operators explanation

- $set: Set the value of a field in a document.
- $unset: Remove the specified field from a document.
- $inc: Increment the value of the field by the specified amount.
- $in: This one is used for filtering documents, if you passed in this filter, it will only update the documents that match the filter
- $push: Add an item to an array.
- $pushAll: Add several items to an array.
- $addToSet: Add an item to an array only if it is not in the array already.
- $pop: Remove the first or last item of an array.
- $pull: Remove all array elements that match a specified query.
- $pullAll: Remove several items from an array.
- $currentDate: Set the value of a field to current date, either as a Date or a Timestamp.
- $bit: Perform bitwise AND, OR, or XOR updates on an integer field.
- $isolated: Modifies behavior of write operations to return the document before modifications.
- $min: Only update the field if the specified value is less than the existing field value.

### 6\. Some gotchas in GET /new-feed

Currently, each time you call GET on this api, it will automatically increase views for the tweets returned in the response Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯.

However, Twitter handled this differently, they only increase a tweet's views when the user actually scrolls the tweet into view. So, if future Khoi wanna change this, just remove the view increasing function and apply a new route to increase views, then Front-end will call this route when the user scrolls a specific tweet into view
